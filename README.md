# CAHSPR 2024 Webpage

A website providing supplementary information to my poster titled "Creating an open-source tool to model opioid overdoses and deaths", which I presented at [CAHSPR 2024](https://cahspr.ca/events/cahspr-2024/), May 14-16th, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The website is made using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and the opioid use state diagram is made using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/).
