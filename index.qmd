# The Opioid Epidemic

Canada has seen an increasing number of opioid-related harms and deaths, with an estimated 39,435 opioid-related hospitalizations and 40,642 apparent opioid toxicity deaths between January 2016 and June 2023[^1]. This is an unprecedented crisis, which the Government of Canada is tackling across a range of fronts[^2]. Policymakers dealing with the opioid crisis, at all levels of government, are faced with difficult questions about the trajectory of the epidemic, as well as questions about which policy interventions would be effective in reducing the number of deaths and overdoses (e.g. decriminalization, provision of safe injection sites, among other policies).

# Background and context

While Statistics Canada, specifically the Health Analysis Division (HAD), has been involved in modelling chronic disease outcomes for many years, previous models have concentrated on a national or provincial picture. Both the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid crisis have demonstrated that policy making and prevention efforts in smaller geographic areas, for instance Public Health Units (PHUs) or Health Regions (HRs) are essential to target those at risk and prevent adverse outcomes. This study begins to allow the development of general models that could be used as tools by local level policymakers to project near-term outcomes and to compare alternative policy options.
As well as modelling, Statistics Canada researchers have leveraged survey data, health administrative data and linked data to shed light on patterns of problematic opioid use[^3] and hospitalizations for opioid poisonings[^4]. In addition, through specific collaborations in BC[^5] and Ontario[^6], Statistics Canada has created data linkages with local level data that has contributed to understanding opioid overdoes and deaths at lower geographic levels.

# Approach

The objective of this project is to develop a compartmental agent-based risk model which will simulate the frequency and outcomes of opioid use in a synthetic population, leveraging detailed socio-demographic and other data. The model will include functionality that allows for the application of policies and interventions to model agents in order to determine their impacts in counter-factual or ‘what-if’ scenarios. This functionality allows the model to serve as an analytical tool for policymakers to obtain future projections and compare and contrast policy responses. Model development will follow an open science approach[^7] for research and dissemination. The code will be written in Python, including a user interface and released as an open-source 

# The Model

A synthetic population is generated using the socio-demographic profile of the geographic region. The model includes two compartmental layers for its agents, as well a set of events that may occur: 

+ **Opioid use state:** the way in which a model agent uses opioids
+ **Opioid use locations:** the location in which they are currently using opioids
+ **Events:** The flow of agents through the previous two compartmental layers, as well as outcomes of opioid use, may be impacted by time-based events. These events can apply to a specific individual or the population as a whole

Compartment transition and opioid use outcome probabilities are governed by risk models, which are parametrized nationally. They are also subject to local multipliers which are derived from specific geographies and populations.

## Locations

+ Housing status
+ Hospital
+ Prison
+ Safe site
+ Other

Location of opioid use may impact outcomes of an overdose. Model agents move through these possible locations as if it were a second compartment model.


## Events

+ Supply contamination
+ Injuries
+ Social assistance cheques
+ Overdoses

Frequency and impact of such events may be local, i.e., dependant on the specific PHU or HR.

# Interventions

A key feature of a modeling approach is the ability to study counter-factual scenarios via variable opioid interventions. For example, the model can simulate the effects of:

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Take-home naloxone kit availability

Determines the number of naloxone kits available to take home at each moment in time. The probability of a model agent receiving a kit depends on the total number of agents as well as the number of remaining available kits.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Opioid prescription reduction

Affects the rate at which opioid prescriptions are administered.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon=false}
### OAT prescription alteration

Affects the rate at which Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT) is prescribed.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Point-of-contact interventions
This intervention represents a broad class of interventions which may occur when an opioid-using actor comes into contact with the public health system. For example, visits to the hospital, emergency room/depertment, prison, or supervised safe consumption sites.

# Conclusion

With the help of collaborations with local health authorities and subject matter experts, we have begun development of a tool that can support policy makers and researchers interested in investigating opioid-related harms, while simultaneously being openly available and easy to use. A focus on sub-provincial geographies and adaptability will further ensure that the model remains useful in a variety of scenarios.
